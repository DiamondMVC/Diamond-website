HOME_EU_COOKIE_TITLE=EU Cookie Law Compliant
HOME_EU_COOKIE_CONTENT:
Since Diamond targets enterprise development, then following the EU cookie law, as well being OWASP compliant is necessary.<br>
<br>
The functionality for supporting the EU Cookie is built-in to Diamond's cookie API, which allows you to specify cookie types as well bind a user's cookie-consent to the functionality, limiting cookies to the functionality they choose.<br>
<br>
In most frameworks this is something you have to build yourself or use a third-party library, but by having it built-in Diamond allows for one less dependency, allowing Diamond to work much better independent.<br>
<br>
It also allows Diamond to combine such functionality with other features of Diamond, without any complexity.
