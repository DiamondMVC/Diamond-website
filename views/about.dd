    Diamond is a full-stack web-framework written in The D Programming Language.<br>
    <br>
    The project was started in 2016 as an alternative template engine to vibe.d's Diet templates, but has evolved into a full-blown framework serving as a layer on-top of vibe.d<br>
    <br>
    Diamond provides additional features to what vibe.d provides and aims to be a product for enterprise development.
